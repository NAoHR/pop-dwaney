can we just repeat that moment again?

when we stared at each other and smiled.that time i realized that loving is just a simple thing.

when we fell deep into silent conversation and just staring each other without even let any words popped out of our mouth

it's been almost 2 years since i saw you.

but your smile,beautiful eyes,and soft spoken words still gassing in my head

is it to late to start over again?

can we just pretend that something has never been going on?

keep doing things you loved
